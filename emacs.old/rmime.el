;; Keywords: MIME, mail

;;; Commentary:

;; RMIME provides MIME support for several Emacs message reading
;; packages.  RMIME has been designed with RMAIL in mind, but it has
;; also been tested with mh-e and VM.  It should work with most other
;; major modes as well.
;;
;; This is version 1.2 of RMIME.  It was released on May 29th, 1996.
;; For up to date information on the latest version of RMIME, please
;; see http://www.cinti.net/~rmoody/rmime.
;;
;; RMIME requires Emacs version 19.28 or greater.  Emacs version 19.29
;; or greater is required for full functionality.
;;
;; To use this file with RMAIL, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;	(add-hook 'rmail-show-message-hook 'rmime-format)
;;	(add-hook 'rmail-edit-mode-hook    'rmime-cancel)
;;	(autoload 'rmime-format "rmime" "" nil)
;;
;; To use this file with mh-e, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;	(add-hook 'mh-show-mode-hook 'rmime-format)
;;	(autoload 'rmime-format "rmime" "" nil)
;;
;; To use this file with VM, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;	(setq vm-preview-lines t)
;;	(add-hook 'vm-select-message-hook 'rmime-format)
;;	(autoload 'rmime-format "rmime" "" nil)
;;
;; To use this file manually, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;	(autoload 'rmime-mode   "rmime" "" t)

;;
;;		       Defining new MIME types
;;
;; Most new MIME types need only to be defined to metamail.  RMIME
;; only needs to know about MIME types that should be displayed as
;; text in an Emacs buffer.  New MIME types can be defined for
;; metamail by placing entries in $HOME/.mailcap or in a system wide
;; mailcap file.  This is an important feature of RMIME --- most MIME
;; aware packages get their configuration out of mailcap files and so
;; should Emacs.
;;
;; To define new text MIME types to Emacs, define a function in the
;; form:
;;
;; (defun rmime-$(BASETYPE)/$(SUBTYPE) (content type encoding
;;					disposition description) ...)
;;
;; CONTENT is an opaque structure that should only be used with
;; rmime-content-excursion or rmime-insert-content or
;; rmime-insert-unencoded-content or rmime-rmime-write-content.
;;
;; TYPE is a string taken from the Content-Type field, or nil if the
;; Content-Type field was empty or not supplied.  Comments and
;; newlines followed by whitespace have been removed from the string.
;; The string may be passed to rmime-parameters for further parsing.
;;
;; ENCODING is a string taken from the Content-Encoding field.  It has
;; been converted to lowercase and is never nil.  The empty string is
;; used if the field is empty or not supplied.
;;
;; DISPOSITION is a string taken from the Content-Disposition field,
;; or nil if the Content-Disposition field was empty or not supplied.
;; Comments and newlines followed by whitespace have been removed from
;; the string.  The string may be passed to rmime-parameters for
;; further parsing.
;;
;; DESCRIPTION is a string taken from the Content-Description field,
;; or nil if the Content-Description field was empty or not supplied.
;;
;; If the rmime-$(BASETYPE)/$(SUBTYPE) symbol has the rmime-unwise
;; property set, it will not be called while formatting a
;; Multipart/Alternative body part except as a last resort.  This
;; property should be set for MIME types that don't produce text or
;; produce text that doesn't display well in an Emacs buffer.  This
;; property should also be set when SUBTYPE is "*".  Also, the
;; Multipart/Alternative formatting code will backup if a error symbol
;; containing rmime-unknown-conventions is signaled.
;;
;; The formatting function should insert the MIME body part into the
;; Emacs buffer as best as possible.
;;
;; The formatting function should return a list of four element lists:
;;		((point content type encoding)
;;		 (point content type encoding)
;;			...
;;		 (point content type encoding))
;; This list of four element lists is used to call metamail.  Metamail
;; deals with MIME body parts containing sounds, images, etc by
;; calling an external viewer.  If the MIME body part displays
;; perfectly in an Emacs buffer, metamail doesn't have to be called
;; and the list of four element lists can be the empty list.  Usually,
;; metamail needs to be called once for each MIME body part and the
;; list of four element lists contains exactly one four element list.
;; Multipart body parts may need to call metamail several times.  In
;; this case, the list of four element lists can contain many four
;; element lists.
;;
;; POINT is a marker showing where the rmime overlay arrow should
;; appear while metamail is showing this MIME body part (or nil if no
;; overlay arrow is desired)
;;
;; CONTENT is the opaque structure (the formatting function's first
;; parameter).
;;
;; TYPE is a character string describing the Content Type to metamail.
;; The formatting function's second parameter works fine here.
;;
;; ENCODING is a character string describing the Content Encoding to
;; metamail.  The formatting function's third parameter works fine
;; here.
;;
;; No function starting with "rmime-" and containing a slash should be
;; defined unless it is safe to call for an unauthenticated message.
;;
;; The MIME formatting should be independent of Emacs state (ie, fill
;; column) and of other MIME messages.  Once formatting is performed
;; on a message, it sticks even if the Emacs state changes or new,
;; associated MIME messages arrive.
